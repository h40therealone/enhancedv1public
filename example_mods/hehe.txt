Street edition Enhanced (V1)

NOTE FROM H40

this mod took like 2 months or something so make sure to like and subscribe 
(its just something I say alot dont take it personally lol)

WHAT IS STREET EDITION?

Street edition is a dave and bambi fanmod created by h40 aka justinstreets,
the mod features dave and bambi and some other characters,
there is 10 playable songs and 6 other songs included in the dlc (16 songs)
the development took around 2 months and is pretty cool in my opinion

WHAT DOES IT INCLUDE?
 -Easy, Normal, And Hard charts for the main weeks

  Mostly The main weeks in story mode are charted from easy to Hard
     so yall dont have to worry about being bad and not being able to play the mod and can actually
                       play it.
        !! -> freeplay songs arent charted easy normal and hard but may be in future updates. <- !!

 -DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT (DLC)
   
   features "vs reginald reborn the horror movie" and an earlier mod folder of street edition containing 
   the old "the-beast" and a scrapped song known as "workshop", and includes bambi week but made really earlier

    !! -> the very first street edition was gonna be included but due to mess ups we lost the folder. <- !!

 -locked weeks and stuff (progression?)

   isnt that suprising but this will force you to play the songs in order and then only after
   you complete all main weeks you can unlock freeplay songs, I just thought it was cool
   and decided to add it.

   !! -> -NEW SETTINGS N STUFF <- !!
     THIS IS IMPORTANT
     its recommended you go to options and "song specific settings" to configure some settings
     as some of these could be important for preferences.
